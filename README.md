# Porto

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.2.
I also got a bit side tracked when i realised that i'm not too good at using event emitters or emitting stuff around
I found a great video that teaches you how event emitters work, very good clear and concise

So this is just a sample event mitter thing using bootstrap.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## How to get setup and running

first use the command 

`npm install`

wait for installation to be complete, after that enter

`ng serve`

Take a look at the code my article and/or video to get a better understanding on whats going on.
